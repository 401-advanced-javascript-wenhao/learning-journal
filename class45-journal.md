# Class 45 - Final Exam and Final Project - 6/12/2020

## Final Exam

I had my final exam with Lena today. It was harder than I expected and the problem description is very long. I came up with a brute force way immediatly with time complexity of O(n), but Lena wanted me to solve this problem with optimal solution and cover all edge cases. So I used binary search pattern to iterate input data to achieve time complexity O(log(n)). Overall, I passed exam and it was very good experience with valuable feedback.

## Final Project Progress

After I finished my final exam, I started working on final project. I was working on fixing google OAuth that we implemented in midterm project. I tried to use the same handshake process I used in the Github OAuth. But google OAuth docs doesn't have any reference about these handshake process. Instead, it recommends client library and its new handshake process. After I did some research on old documents in the forum, I finally found the right API end points for each handshake process that I was using and it finally works.
