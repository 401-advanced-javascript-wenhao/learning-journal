# Project: Final Retro #2 - 6/16/2020

1. What progress did your team make today?  
   Morgan and I were mainly working on signin and signup. Since a lot of API end point CRUD operations require authentication first. Alexs were working on reducers and facebook OAuth.

2. What specific contributions did you make? Please share links to your Pull Requests (or commits) even if they haven't been merged?  
   I was working on connecting Google OAuth to front-end and redirect the user to proper page and give token to user upon successful sign in. I also deployed our front-end to Github pages.<br/>
