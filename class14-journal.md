# Class14 - Access Controls - 4/30/2020

## Basic Authentication, OAuth, Bearer Authentication Recap
* APIs without any authentication middlewares are accessible by anyone.
* Basic Authentication generates a token for users based on username and password they provided when they sign in or sign up. This token will be used later for user authentication for subsequent request.
* OAuth uses third party services such as github, google, facebook etc to authenticate users and grant applicaion access without giving application their password. At the end of this process, application will generate a token for users and this token will be used later for user authentication for subsequent request.
* Bearer authentication uses a token that generated by basic authentication or OAuth to authenticate users for their request. In this way, users don't have to send their credentials over the network every time they make a request or go through OAuth process every time they make a request.

## Access Control List
Selective restriction of resources.
* Limit API access to users by their role. 
  * admin - full access > create, read, update, and delete
  * editor - create, read, update and no user management
  * guest - read
  * user - logged in user with read and maybe comment
* need to handle on both frontend and backend
