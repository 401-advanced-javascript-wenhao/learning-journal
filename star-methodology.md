## Question: What is one of your greatest accomplishment?

* Situation
I came to U.S. 8 years ago for my academic goal and it was really open my eyes. I saw myself better future and opportunity here in the U.S. But I had to leave U.S. after completion of degree by regulations. I found a program called MAVNI that gives me a path to gain citizenship through military service. But most of recruiters were't familiar with this pilot program and the program was temporarily closed for the fiscal year and they only recruit 20 people for my language in my region.

  * I found best recruiter who is an expert on MAVNI program and communicated with him on weekly basis.
  * I served honorably 4 years as active duty in medical field in the Army.
* Result
  * I earned my citizenship through service and my next generation have rights to live in this great nation.
  * I am open to better opportunity and pursing my dream job.
