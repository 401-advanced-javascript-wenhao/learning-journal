# Star Methodology - 5/6/2020

## Question: What is one of your greatest accomplishments?

* Situation
  * I came to the U.S. 8 years ago for my academic goal and it really opened my eyes. I saw a better future and opportunity here in the U.S. But I had to leave the U.S. after completion of degree by regulations.
  * I found a program called MAVNI that gives me a path to gain citizenship through military service. But most of the recruiters were not familiar with this pilot program and the program was temporarily closed for the fiscal year and they only recruited 20 people for my language in my region.

* Task
  * I needed to do more research about the MAVNI program.
  * I needed to find a recruiter who is experienced in the MAVNI program.
  * I had to physically and mentally prepare for the duty.
* Action
  * I proactively prepared for all processing steps and all required documents so that when the program opens I am good to go.
  * I found a best recruiter who is an expert on the MAVNI program and communicated with him on a weekly basis.
  * I served honorably 4 years as active duty in the medical field in the Army.
* Result
  * I earned my citizenship through service and my next generation have rights to live in this great nation.
  * I am open to better opportunities and pursuing my dream job.
