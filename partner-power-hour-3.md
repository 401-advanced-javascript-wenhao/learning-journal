# Web components: design systems by Dale Sande
Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. React also allows you to create custom and resuable components. But there are some problems with React. One of the problems is JSX, it needs babel to transpile it to be compatible with most of mordern browser. The other problem is not everyone knows React even though it is most popular font-end JS library. So, use React to design system is not a good idea. On the other hand, web components are based on exisiting web standards. Features to support web components are currently being added to the HTML and DOM specs, letting web developers easily extend HTML with new elements with encapsulated styling and custom behavior.
