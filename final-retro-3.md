# Project: Final Retro 3 - 6/17/2020

1. What progress did your team make today?  
   Our basic authentication and google OAuth is working, so we are getting token user info upon successful signin. Users use this token to make subsequent request so that they don't need to sign in frequently.

2. What specific contributions did you make? Please share links to your Pull Requests (or commits) even if they haven't been merged?  
   I was working on sign-in form and connecting basic authentication to front-end and redirect the user to proper page and give token to user upon successful sign in. This is major progress since most of our API end point is protected by bearer auth and users need a token to access it.<br/>
