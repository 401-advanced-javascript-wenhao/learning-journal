# Networking Update - 5/31/2020 

I have added two Amazon Linkedin connections, and one of them is senior program manager and he is also in charge of hiring process for the team. He shared his thought about current job market trends in software engineering industry. He said that due to COVID19 situation, a lot of people lost jobs and companies are not hiring people as much as usual but there is some exception. Amazon is still hiring software engineers and some of their programs are still open for candidates. I am going to leverage the connection and opportunity and apply a position in the Amazon shortly.
