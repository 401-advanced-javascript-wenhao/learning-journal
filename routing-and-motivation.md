# Routine and Motivation - 6/13/2020

My plan after this program is that do 2 mid-level code challenges every day and practice css and polish my previous projects. The technologies and languages that I want to learn myself are Docker, React Native, Python and Java.  
Currently, I am working on two job opportunities and prepare resume for it.
