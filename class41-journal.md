# Class 41 - React Native - 6/8/2020  

## React state management recap 
1. redux - provides access to state 
2. component - class, function, hooks: useState 
3. context  

## React Native Ecosystem 
* Native development - using native machine code to run apps connected directly to hardware and OS features
* Performance and quality are preserved 
* Consistent user experience  
* It's still just state and components
  * But no HTML or CSS  
  * You can still "style" things using the framework guidelines 

## Expo 
* expo is the dev environment 
* snack is online sandbox
* expo-cli is the local equivalent to create-react-app (you can eject)  
* running locally, you can use your own device or the official simulator  
  * only Apple users can test iphones 
  * Anyone can test android, but you need to start up an ADB from the Android Studio IDE
