# Partner Power Hour 7 - 6/5/2020 

## Intro to Data Structures and Whiteboarding strategies - presentedy by Amber Kim  
  ### Why are we talking about whiteboarding  
  * Popular way of interviewing
  * Actually relevant in the workplace  
    * How you think through problems  
    * How you collaborate
  * The same way of thinking can be applied to other interview process  

  ### Data Structures 
  * A way to store data
  * How we file them away 
  * How to retrieve them  
  * How they relate to each other 
  * Queue (FIFO) - Fist In First Out - Use case: event queue, event server   
  * Stack (FILO) - First In Last Out - Use case: call stack 
  * Hashtable - store key/value pair in a fixed size array  

  ### Whiteboarding 
  * Questions to ask  
    * What are the requirements 
    * How should the data be presented or stored  
    * Examples: best case, worst/unusual/edge cases 
    * What are you allowed to do/use  
  * Things to think about 
    * What is important to your interviewer 
    * The easy way/brute force way first unless there is a different requirement  
    * If you need to loop through data, which one is the most appropriate 
    * If you are breaking down a problem, which part is most important  
  * What to do  
    * Slow down 
    * Think things out loud 
    * Try to have conversation with your interviewer  
    * Listen  
    * Process 
    * Ask good questions  
      * This is what I know 
      * These are the requirements  
      * This is the problem 
      * This is how I might approach it 
      * Plus side to my thinking  
      * Down side to my thinking  
  * Whiteboarding Steps 
    * Gather requirements 
    * Get examples/visual 
    * Pseudo code/Algorithm 
    * Verify/Test 
  * Remember to 
    * Draw/Illustrate things out when you can 
    * Take a moment with every step to verify with interviewer if you are going to the right direction  
    * Find problems early 
    * Verify/Test 
  * Challenge, moving forward...  
    * Fail fast 
    * You are also interviewing your interviewer  
      * See how they work and collaborate 
      * See if they will provide what you need to grow as developer 
      * Will they provide a good working environment  
    * Collect data  
      * On problems and questions that are being used 
      * How you did, what could you have done better  
      * Things you noticed with the process and the people you talked to  
    * Use the data  
      * To improve your interview skills  
      * To get better at choosing where you apply, where is it worth your time and effort 
      * To see how you are actually doing better today than yesterday
