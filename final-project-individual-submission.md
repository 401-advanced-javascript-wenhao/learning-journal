# Final Project Individual Submission - 6/19/2020

1. Describe your overall satisfaction level with your project results.  
   My overall satisfaction level with project is 7 out of 10. We complete MVP but a lot of details are not yet implemented and deployed application was not working very well. We definitely could have done it better.

2. What went well and what did not?  
   Building most of our core features implementation went well but we didn't complete detailed features. Deployed app was not working properly and one of our team member didn't contribute to the project.

3. How would you compare the outcome with your vision for the project?  
   We accomplished most of objectives we set in the beginning of the project. Login, Google OAuth, show my items, show others items, create an item, start rental process, show previous rentals are working. Deployed Front-end and Back-end were working independantly, but there were some problems while connected to each other in production mode.

4. Briefly describe your group dynamic for the week.  
   We were working together all day on zoom and use Trello to manage our project. We were tracking what features are each team members working on and help each other if we had road blocks. We had one team member who didn't contribute to the project, we reported this issue to instructor.

5. Were there any problems that proved insoluble?  
   When we met challenges or road blocks, we were trying to solve this ourselves first by helping each other. If we stuck too long, we brought the problems to instructor during standup. We didn't have problems that proved insoluble.

6. Are there any team members you would call out for particular kudos?  
   I would call out for Morgan. He is very knowledgeable and professional and very dedicated to this project. He spent 15 hours a day for the project and contributed on some core features on our project.

7. Describe at least one difficulty you faced during project week and how you dealt with it. This difficulty could be technical in nature, or interpersonal.  
   The first feature I was working on for this project was fixing Google OAuth. The person who wrote this feature during mid-term project used 4-way handshake process. But google OAuth official docs obsolete this method and encourage new way to implement it. However, I kept original code and debugged the code step by step and found out bugs and wrong urls for request. I looked up old posts in tech communities and found right urls for each request and fixed bugs and finally google OAuth was working.

8. Describe at least one surprising success or failure you experienced during the week.  
   We spent most of time on the development and we started working on deployment one hour prior our final presentation. We thought if it is working on development it will work perfectly fine on deployment. But we were wrong, our front-end and back-end were working fine independently in production mode, but when we connect each other, it wasn't working as expected, some features are not working properly. In the end, we had to use our local to do presentation.

9. Describe changes you would make to your personal or team process that you can incorporate into your next team effort.  
   One of lesson I learned from this project was that make sure leave enough time for deployment. Because there might be some unexpected issues we need to fix on production mode.

10. If there is anything else you wish us to know when assessing your contribution to the group project, please include it. Only members of the Instructional team will read these submissions, so you may be candid.  
    In this project, I contributed on Google OAuth, Login, Login Form, Items component, Headers component etc.
