# Final Project Individual Submission - 6/19/2020

1. Describe your overall satisfaction level with your project results.  
   My overall satisfaction level with project is 7 out of 10. We complete MVP but a lot of details are not yet implemented and deployed application was not working very well. We definitely could have done it better.

2. What went well and what did not?  
   Building most of our core features implementation went well but we didn't complete detailed features. Deployed app was not working properly and one of our team member didn't contribute to the project.
3. How would you compare the outcome with your vision for the project?

4. Briefly describe your group dynamic for the week.

5. Were there any problems that proved insoluble?

6. Are there any team members you would call out for particular kudos?

7. Describe at least one difficulty you faced during project week and how you dealt with it. This difficulty could be technical in nature, or interpersonal.

8. Describe at least one surprising success or failure you experienced during the week.

9. Describe changes you would make to your personal or team process that you can incorporate into your next team effort.

10. If there is anything else you wish us to know when assessing your contribution to the group project, please include it. Only members of the Instructional team will read these submissions, so you may be candid.
