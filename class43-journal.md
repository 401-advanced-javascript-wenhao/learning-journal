# Class 43 - Angular JS and other Frameworks - 6/10/2020

## Angular JS

HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. Angular JS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

- Extensibility - Angular JS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs.

## Other Frameworks

- Vue.js
- Next.js
- Gatsby.js
