   I was mainly working on fixing the google OAuth in dev and production mode and then working on users related form and connection between front-end and back-end. After that I spent some time to try to understand theme code we are using.<br/>

3. What has been most challenging today?  
   I got google OAuth worked in my personal repo but it took me more than I expected to fix the google OAuth in our project repo since there are a lot of files and google OAuth part was written by someone else. It ended up most of bugs were typos but it were very hard to spot on even though I debugged handshake process one by one.
